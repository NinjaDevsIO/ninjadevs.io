   Tested with Firefox 39 and Chrome 43 on the following themes:

    - Twenty Ten (version 1.9)
    - Twenty Eleven (version 2.1)
    - Twenty Twelve (version 1.7)
    - Twenty Thirteen (version 1.5)
    - Twenty Fourteen (version 1.4)
    - Twenty Fifteen (version 1.2)

   Also tested with a number of popular non-offocial themes, such as

    - Vantage
    - Customizr
    - ColorWay
    - Zerif Lite
    - Responsive
    - Storefront
    - Virtue
    - evolve
    - Make
    - Sparkling
    - Spacious
    - Enigma
    - Sydney
    - Point
    - Interface
    - SinglePage 

   Ensuring a nice and normalized visual appearance out-of-the-box with a
   number of themes requires to make certain compromises. It turned out that
   forcing the font size to an absolute value is key component, as well as
   using the !important flag for crucial componenta like font-size, margins,
   line-height (many themes apply id-based selectors to pre-blocks, which
   have a significantly higher specificity than the class-based styles
   applied here).

   I tried to cover/normalize the style via many relevant selectors. However,
   certain themes might define styles with a high specificity that affect the
   code block appearance negatively. It is difficult to impossible to anticipate
   these cases in advance, so I expect this to happen (and the past has proven
   me right in this regard). So, I need you to look out for these situations!
   In these cases, you need to identify the corresponding selectors and override
   your theme's styles by adjusting this file (wp-geshi-highlight.css), and
   placing it in your in your theme's directory. There, it survives updates of
   this plugin. It would also be great if you could contact me in these cases,
   so that I can improve this file in future releases.
